It is a lot of fun the kids really enjoy this game they say it is a little different than the other games they play,1
Great game...it amuses me for quite a long time and enjoy trying to get through all the boards.  Have gotten other angry birds games.,1
I finally found out why everyone is playing Angry Birds.  It is a very fun and slightly addictive game.  I like the many different levels.,1
"Never thought I'd get addicted to this game. In fact, my 4 year is addicted to this game. It's fun and challenging at the same time.",1
I love playing this game and still play it to this day. My only issue is that it is getting too difficult to pass.,1
All I know is that my kids love these birds the kindle version is great and mobile love this and suggest for all families.,1
1st I have to uninstall in order to get the new update. Now it crashes everytime I try to do any of the older levels. Rovio this is BS!!!!!!,0
I decided to get this app to learn why everyone kept talking about it. It's simple - it's fun and a bit of a mind bender. Just challenging enough to keep you occupied while you laugh at the set-ups. Good time.,1
"Amazing game! if you've never played Angry Birds before, start here!Its the new Pacman for sure!Great for kids, teens, and the elderly!",1
For those days you have to wait or try to keep your tongue this is the game.  I thought it was just for kids but no!!!  This is great and gets better and better the farther you go.  A must for folks that like to challenge their minds.,1
Several levels. So it is fun for all of us. I can get lost for hours playing this one. Makes one think about angles and things to win. Now I know why all the kids are love Angry Birds.,1
"Had been hearing for ages and ages about Angry Birds and thought to give it a try with the free app for Kindle.  IMMEDIATELY sucked in, my oldest 2 daughters (7 and 4) like to play it as a treat when school work, chores, etc. are done for the afternoon. ",1
"Okay, this is by far the best you can get from a free game. This has about ten or more stages with about 30 levels on each,so we are talking about 300 or 400 levels - no joke! This game also comes with like 20 mini episodes ( also totally free) that you ",1
"This game is too much fun not to have.  I haven't had any problems with the App at all.  A challenging game for sure, but it is fun and funny. I had to go online to find out what each bird does but that was not an issue.",1
Got this app for my new Kindle Fire HD.  Had the app previously on my android phone.  This is so much better. Graphics looks great.  Havent played much b/c my hubby is addicted. LOL,1
"The last level on the newest stage is so hard that it can very close to rage quit, bui still like the entire game.",1
"This is another game that I usually play on my phone and having it on my kindle fire is great.  It's a great game to fill waiting times in restaurants, airports, etc or during commercials at home.",1
This game is addicting.  You just want those bird to get all of the pigs.  I could play this for hours.,1
This game has no problems now you know theirs very very very very hoo  ads take me you will love it I this bored when I finished the game with all stars cause possibly angry birds is possible.,1
So many birds! So many levels! It's a really great deal! If I were you I would have bought it! It's really cool! And I'm not just saying that because the birds are cool! I hope you enjoy it.,1
"Definitely addictive.  Once you get past the first couple of levels, it gets more challenging.  sometimes frustrating!  I think if yu are an engineer or studied physics, you would do well at this game!  Fun--especially passing the time waiting in the doc",1
the younger kids like it alot,1
"It's so much fun, my husband and I  play it together.I don't care for the war games etc. but I love the simple little birds and piggies.",1
Who doesnt love angry birds.... The game is fun and challenging.  Provides many levels which get harder and harder... So much fun it becomes addicting,1

He loves anything that has to do with Angry Birds. Sure has helped me when I need to keep him occupied.,1

My wife got a Kindle and plays all the time more than reading her books. Shes better than I am,1
I had heard about this game and tried to see if I liked it. But what I found was the puzzles are too hard and I wasted a ridiculous amount of time attempting to solve them. I deleted the game from my tablet.,0

"Great game, loads of fun, even better on the Fire than on a smart phone, larger and easier to see while you take out evil pigs!",1
This game hooked me on Angry Birds. After this I had to go out and get even more angry birds.:),1
Despite becoming a pop culture Icon...this game goes down as one of the all time greets like Pac Man or Mario. Brothers. it holds up and continues to feel fresh no matter how many times you play. And who doesn't. try to get three stars on every level?,1
Kids love it. Entertainable will help pass some time in an enjoyable fashion. A great game that is free is always nice.,1

Angry birds is such a good game. Pretty common too. It is about some birds who got their eggs stolen by pigs so now they're out to get them. All of them. You shoot a certain number of angry birds from a slingshot and try to get all the pigs with the limi,1
I think Angry Birds Free is great!  I play it both on my Kindle and online on Facebook too.  It is lots of fun!,1
"I love it so much, and it is so great, my mother is addicted to it!  You should make angry birds mario, but it is AWESOME!!! 5/5! Well, really 240000/5!",1

"Got so engrossed in the game that I forgot it was demo!  Will have to purchase because I want to get further!Majesty was great on my PC, and this app fits the bill also!",1
Installs but when run will send you to the webpage to buy the pay version. Then it just crashes when you try to run it again.Amazon should remove this free version and perhaps even the pay version.This is not good.,0
this was a real fail! its almost impossible to win and its really difficult to use!!! I don't even understand why I got it. it was immediately uninstalled.,0
won't even let me open it. its up for like 3 seconds and then closes. I want out. I don't even know how to uninstall this. I'm not very happy at all.,0
I love it at first its a little hard until u know what u r doing but once u r hood and know what u r doing its great,1
"I could not play this it was too boring and confusing I'm going to delete it of my kindle right after this, I wouldn't recommend getting this app",0
If youlook at teh other reviews you will notice people like this game when it works.  It's free so you might as well give it a shot.,1
"Great game unless you are stupid enough to download an app that doesnt work on your device, hence all the 1 star reviews.",1
Majesty is a very fun and adicting game.  i tried the trial version first and then bought the full game.  Trial version allows you to play several locations to give a taste of the game.  Purchasing the game opens up more content. i hope the devs will be ,1
First off the controls for this app are stupid because you can't control the heroes that you hire. they just walk where ever they want to go and the graphics are terrible. got this for my kindle fire and it wasn't even worth downloading for 5 minutes. wo,0
I do not like this one I liked the one on my old Kindle better it was bore fun and challenging to play,0
Got it and was not pleased. Had to delete it. Thought it would be better but fell short. I am sure I will find one that measures up at another time. Sorry this wasn't it.,0

"This app is so good & easy to use I actually purchased the full version (& I don't purchase many Apps because I don't mind the advertisements). It is a must have App.  I use the clock, quick alarm & have many recurring alarms set.  You can silence your p",1
I set this alarm twice and it never went off...I'm not really sure why. Maybe I will try again at a later time but this didn't work at all for me on the Fire HD.,0
"i owned this app for probably three months. i've never had a problem i couldn't solve. the customizability is endless, i especially love being able to wake up to a different song in music library everyday. great stuff!",1
"I got this app as the free app of the day a while ago, I liked it so much I went over to the android market and paid for it!  I use this every morning and enjoy awakening to the nature sounds.",1
"This alarm clock is fantastic. I haven't got the full version but when I do I look forward to it. I have this app for my kindle fire and it works great. It has features that allow you to pick what song or melody to wake up to, do math problems before you",1
"Best alarm I have found.So many settings!  It is overwhelming at first, but once you get it dialed in, it is amazing.I have mine start 5 mins before I want to wake up, it begins with tiny trickles of water and slowly gets louder over the 5 mins (the scre",1
I love the app....if only you could buy regular mode for less. sometimes I need an alarm Wednesday but you can always have more than 1 app...the regular version is better,1
Repeatedly crashes on my Kindle Fire after asking if I want to install an add on. Maybe next version will be more compatible as this appears to be just what I want for sn alarm clock app.,0
Amazing alarm. There is something about it ringing gently minutes before the main loud alarm that makes you feel refreshed. I have not had a headache or felt groggy since I started using this alarm.,1
yes its Bejeweled but with enough of a twist to keep it interesting. runs perfectly on both my Samsung galexy prevail and my Acer iconia tab A500 with nice HD graphics on the tablet.,1
This one is fun and after each match 3 or more puzzle you get to buy pieces that help you in the puzzle. You don't spend any real money except for the cost of the game.,1
"If you like matching games, this one is well worth the money. Very polished graphics and gameplay, nothing like the tons of laggy, buggy free match games onthe market. Enough to keep my attention and want to keep playing.",1
I love this game! it plays just fine on my Acer a500 tablet. I played several levels and it ran smooth with no glitches. I will be playing this a lot. Thanks Amazon!,1
"Well done matching game that has great graphics on both my DroidX phone and Toshiba Thrive tablet.  I was given the choice to upload scores or not, as I wished.  The app can be moved to the sd card, too, which is something I like in an app.",1
"This is a jewel matching game.  Nice graphics and sound effects.  Satisfying game play. For those who have the Pandigital Novel, it works great on the 7"" screen. Also works great on my  Android phone.",1
"I hesitated to download this because of the review of a tablet. I took a chance and it runs great on my rooted flashback 7.1, honeycomb viewsonic gtab.  Runs great, good graphics, good game.",1
"This is a great &quot;bejewled&quot; type of game. The graphics are great and the combos keep things interesting. Unlike a lot of other match 3 games, the game feels like it is progressing and going somewhere, which I really liked. There are a bunch of l",1
Works fine on my Dell Streak 7 tablet. I've always liked matching games and this one has a lot more to offer than just matching tiles. Very colorful and works very smooth. I highly recommend it. You can also transfer it to your SD card.,1
"I got this game as the FAOTD. I can't say that I would have paid $1.99 for it, maybe $.99. The game is fun and addictive, but once it starts going fast and you get in the groove, the game is over. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of levels, but there ",1
"The graphics are great, and it runs really smooth on my HTC Incredible. Really fun and addictive! A must have game. Kudos to the dev.",1
This game is a lot of fun and designed perfectly for touch screen gameplay. It has great graphics and music and lots of levels to keep you entertained. I definitely recommend it.,1
"it's a great free game. very fun. even if it's a bejeweled clone, it's a good one with new gameplay features.",1
I really enjoy this game! I downloaded 2 and 3 because they are so much fun. Even my 8 yr old daughter has fun with these. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys the match 3 games..,1
"I love this game, and its sequel, Treasures of Montezuma 3. They are kind of the elite of match-three games. The difficulty level increases appropriately as you get more skilled, and the bonus effects that help you increase your point-earning abilities a",1
"This is a great bejeweled clone, I started playing it and soon realized I just wasted a hour and a half playing this. A good mix in difficulty with enough variety to keep you playing.",1
This game is really really fun and addictive. It has a ton of the stages. This not your basic match 3 game. Each stage has a goal and unlock new powerups the further you get. You have to get rid of a certain amount of special gems per stage and your on a,1
This is a bejeweled clone with lots of added features thats sure to keep you occupied. It's a well thought out match 3 game with puzzles to boot. An achievement badge system. Well worth the $2 after the FAOTD.Fast paced game on the Optimus V,1
Was able to play one game. Now application won't open on device. it is lost in cyberspace never never land.,0
"Great game to play when you're bored, waiting for the plane/train, in between TV shows, just before bed, or anytime, really!  The higher the level, the more difficult it is to get Montezuma to smile.  But you don't want to put it down until you do!!!",1
Have spent hours playing this one on HTC EVO. One of the most fun games I have downloaded. It appears to now work on Kindle Fire as well.Watch out for May 2013 update! Looks like all it does is push advertisements to the game menu screen (where previousl,1
I got totally addicted to this game and completed all levels.  Great way to pass the time.  Kids play it too.,1
"I don't play to many games on my cell but I love this game!! The biggest problem is that its too darn addictive, I can't put it down once I start!!!!",1
Honestly this is a genre that we don't need to continue producing. It's lame. Doesn't anyone have any originality? Barf.,0
"Yes,  this is another jewel game!  BUT it is by far the best!!  Runs great on my droid2.  Thanks amazon! and much thanks to the developer!",1
"I've had this game on my phone for a year now.  Amazingly I still find it the most entertaining Android game I've owned.  I buy them, play a couple of times, get bored, delete them.  This one is a keeper.  Perfect for waiting around in Dr.'s offices or a",1
"Out of all the &quot;match 3&quot; games, this one is my favorite. It DOES work kn the Kindle Fire, contrary to someone else's review. It always has, and that's how I've played since I bought mine in December.The game has a ton of levels, and lots of pow",1
I like the totems and bonuses. They make the game sort of unpredictable and ultimately more fun. I also like the puzzle mode. They took the gem game concept to another level with this app. Really great. Really fun.,1
"Works perfect on samsung galaxy.  Fun game, enough story to keep you interested, and nice clean graphics. 18 19 20",1
"Thought this would be another Bejeweled knockoff, but the added features are great. Was free app of the day months ago. Still enjoying it, and would buy it, if I ever needed to.",1
"I downloaded the free one at first, and I ended up downloading this one. It's always better to get the games you have to pay for, because the free ones, you end of having to pay in the long run anyway. I played one fast game on the free game, and I ended",1
"A fun game and long play time.  Worked well with Samsung Tab2.0, Pandigital Planet and would hang sometime with Pandigital Novel.",1
I really like how this game involves unlocking features such as bomb tiles and special abuilities like getting two tripplets in a row of the same color can grant you some special bonus power.  Power ups clustered in a match three game works.,1
"I picked it up as the deal of the day from Amazon, so I couldn't go wrong.  I don't know that I would have paid for it, but for a free game, it holds entertainment value.  It is very similar to all the other gem type games out there, but it is VERY addic",1
This is a wonderful game! Those who have compared it to Bejeweled are only correct in that you match the types to clear the board. But.... There is a LOT more to this game! You have to build buildings  with gold you earn by playing and earn tokens to hel,1
"I tried this game and I am glad I did. I was looking for Jewel Quest for my kindle, did not find the one I wanted, so I tried this game.It is another matching game, but the graphics are different. Tri it, I am pretty sure you will like it.",1

"Basically bejeweled Aztec style, that being said it's a fun game would def recommend. This is probably why it's been up for 2 days as AFAOTD.",1
I told her about this game being the FAOTD yesterday.  5 hours later she still hadn't set her phone down.  That allowed me to watch Breaking Bad and Storm Chasers. (both are shows she doesn't like)Auto 5 stars!,1
"Extremely fast paced and alot of fun. This game will probably replace my chuzzle addiction. If you cant get into it, delete it. dont give it a bad review. This game os pretty much excellent.",1
makes time fly fly away. couldn't believe the hours passed  by so far. would recommend to anyone who enjoys having fun.,1
I have been playing this game non stop for weeks. A very addictive variant of the classic match 3 game style. Works great on the Toshiba Thrive tablet.,1
"Awesome sound, color and over all feel.  Easy to play, great time killer, overall a great bejewled type of game. A few extra factors separate it from bejewled like earning points to buy some needed items. You won't be disappointed as long as you like col",1

"I find myself opening this app more often than just about any other game I have installed on my phone, and whenever I upgrade my phone, it's one of the first games to get reinstalled.There aren't any in app purchase requirements, a huge plus in my book! ",1
I'm hooked on this game! The ability to get upgrades to the various blocks and idols keeps me wanting to keep playing. I've actually chose this game over playing my Xbox 360 a couple times.,1
I loved this game on the computer when I played it a few years ago and its still a great game!,1
"I'm impressed by how well this works and runs on the Motorola Xoom (WiFi). It's addicting, and really attractive. A pleasure to play.Has become one of my favorite games in just a a day.",1
This is just like so many games where you match three items... but it is a fun updated version with power ups and levels. Not exactly my type of game but it can keep you entertained for a while. Works well on my Motorola Atrix 4g.,1
I never played the first one but I love this one.  It is challenging yet easy to learn.  I like the graphics and there are plenty of levels to keep you busy.  A great time killer and just plain fun.,1
This game is fun and addictive. If you don't like this I don't think you could like ANY kind of app. Once again I LOVE THIS APP.:),1
"This is a fun puzzle game, although it's very difficult to get top marks on the levels. The trick is to wait until you have some new enhancements (totems), and then go back to the older levels.",1

"Hopefully solving video game puzzles is good for your brain, because this is another good entry.  I can spend hours playing.  Good graphics, sounds, and colors.  If you enjoy this kind of thing, give it a try.",1
I have several match 3 type games and this is by far my favorite!  a few new spins makes it more interesting!,1
This game is incredibly addictive. I play it every chance I get.  It is a very interesting and entertaining twist on Bejeweled and the graphics are fabulous.  Love it!,1
New variation to an old idea makes it enjoyable. Nice graphics. It's the kind of game you can pick up and play when you really don't want to be stressing the grey matter. I play it for a break from work.,1
"EVO 4gWorks  extremely well so far. Great fun, no glitches or hangs. Easy to learn. Loads fast. Looks professional.",1
"If you like bejeweled, you'll love this game. If not, you'll complain about amazon giving us too many free bejeweled games.Either way, it's free, so no complaints.",1
I know it is a good app when I can't stop playing it. it has more to it than just the jewel game.,1
"Finally some polish! This game is fun, beautiful, smooth, and substantial. Yes it's a  Bejeweled clone at heart, but that's not really a problem unless you didn't like Bejeweled. And this one has lots of fun extras. The professional design is so nice, as",1
This is the best game out there on Android right now as far as gem swapping is concerned. I play it all the time. It has some features that separate it from other games of its type such as power ups from landing 2 or 3 of the same type of matches in a ro,1
Got this when it was the free app but would definately be worth the $1.99.  I found this 3-in-a-row match game a lot better than others because you have a progress and can buy totems/upgrades plus you can compare your progressiom online vs other players.,1
"I have had this game on my Toshiba Thrive for well over a year and it is my favorite go to game. At least it was until it started requiring internet access to run. Now it won't open when I travel. This is a single player game, there is NO GOOD reason it ",0

"very addictive, reminiscent of bejewelled play style.  has a gradually increasing difficulty level with unlockable special powers. graphics and interface are nice on the fire",1
Love the look of this game and the music is ok too. Very addictive. Find that this is becoming one of my most played apps.,1
This is a game of hours of fun and many challenges that I have enjoyed conquering.  I think you will enjoy it just as much as I do.,1
"Great game. Just cant put it down. i have it on my Droid, Asus tablet and my Kindel Fire. Very addicting.",1
What seems like another boring old gemswap game is definitely something more. You have to swap the gems with inner gems to complete the round. You also have to collect coins to buy little trophies that will help you through the levels. I think the only r,1

I play this game every night before bed. It takes my mind off of my worries and relaxes me so I can sleep like a baby!  I love this game!,1
I am rating the game. Not Amazons choice for FAOTD or the fact that the developer chose to make a game of this type. There are channels for that. Amazon customer service and developer feedback. It is so immature and irresponsible to leave a low rating fo,1
I am enjoying this game. I do really like the jewel type games and this one has a nice theme and is different than others I've played before. I am glad I downloaded it. it works well on HTC evo.,1

"I just got this and when I tested it, perfect! I like the feature that it can show you the lyrics. Great app. Thanks for making this!",1
"It works great, finds the songs you need and is only second to Soundhound because you can't really hum songs into it.",1
i only tried 2 tags. one on tv and another from a music clip in YouTube. it worked both times. only if i could have had this app years ago when i was recording instrumental music on cassette tapes. i has a few sings i need to know who they are.,1
"I recently bought a new truck and one of the features I miss most about my old one is that the radio does not display the name of the song on the radio.  Not the end of the world, but now I don't sweat it anymore thanks to Shazam.Shazam listens to a bit ",1
For me I have had both sound hound and this app and for me this app was far better and faster at identifying songs especially in noisy conditions. sometimes identifying songs almost immediately after pushing the button. Blazing fast and highly recommende,1

"I don't know about the bad reviews. I've had this since day one and it has never let me down. I can't vouch for soundhound, don't feel I need to. Shazam never once missed a tag, from the 3 sec tv show or the car with the windows open.",1
Hasn't missed a song yet. Even picking up some indie rock. And it automatically keeps a record so you can go back later and see which songs you listened to that day to download.,1
This app has never ceased to amaze me when I'm trying to figure out a song and I have my phone handy. Great app!,1
Works every time. Always gets the song right. Then I can watch it on youtube or share it on Facebook or buy the mp3 from Amazon. Pretty sick.,1
"if you can't get it to install, DON'T LEAVE A BAD RATING. that's more your problem than the developers. mine installed flawlessly. -Nexus S 2.3.3",1
"I've been using Shazam since I first got an Android phone (April 2010) and it's always been my go to app when I need music identified.  For the most part it's incredibly accurate, but once you start trying to identify more obscure artists you'll start hi",1
What a great application! Works great on my EVO 4g and because I listen to music all the time this will come in extremely handy. Thanks amazon for the unlimited version for free.,1
The future is now. It never got anything on the radio wrong. Even remixes. An app that can make my doctorate in DJ-ing and my masters in music recognition seem like a waste of time? It's the apocalypse alright.,1
"I was originally going to give this app 5 stars, but now that I keep getting the Amazon Appstore: unknown error message and it keeps force closing.. I have to igve it 1 star.. please fix this..",0
"One of the biggest features that they advertise is the 3D Lyrics. However, after I purchased the &quot;encore&quot; or paid version that feature was greyed out. I missed the opportunity to get Shazam Encore for free last year, and that is what this is wo",0
I've been meaning to buy Shazam Encore for a while now. This version is ad-free and includes unlimited tagging. Don't forget that any app with ads can send certain information about you to advertisers.Shazam is a wonderfully useful app that you can whip ,1
"This it's a five star application, what I don't understand is how it's being given away free, momentarily anyways. It does what it should, quickly and easily with no complaints. A bit expensive normally though.",1
"Shazam is now more likely to provide quick and accurate results than SoundHound. This wasn't always the case. I've had this app since it was available free in March 2011. Initially, I preferred SoundHound because the earlier versions of Shazam performed ",1
"This app has found 98% of the songs that I&apos;ve searched for, including the ones playing in a crowded room. The youtube link also works well. Evo 4G.",1
This is one of the best apps out there to know what music is playing from tv shows to movies,1
This app is amazing! It works great and I love the ability to tag when there is no data connection. I use it almost everyday. Samsung Galaxy Tab.,1
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio, maybe even during a movie, and just couldn't remember the name of the song or who it was by? Well use this app to tell you! It's amazing just push the big button in the center of the app when it's loaded (It's a b",1

complete failure and soundhound is so much better get working on 3.0 asap you bunch of losers. Not even enough about this app to fill the word minimum.,0
Was amazed when I went to start of a random reggae song and it guessed it from just the start of a melody. Impressive! And you can do so much from watch YouTube video or listen on Pandora from the results!,0
Works great with my atrix( root). I haven't have any issues with the app. The app does an awesome job and is free. 25 word minimun really Amazon?,1
are no longer a problem with this app.  I love shazam.  works like a charm.  have yet to find a song it did not recognize.,1
im really happy that amazon made this app free for a day cuz I was really fed up with the free version. it works very well and I'm surprised it has only an average of 3 stars,1
I also have a spotify account so it's nice that there's integration there.  Or I just get them from the amazon store.,1
Great app for identifying music! UI is also very nice and simple to use.A definite &#34;must have&#34; for music lovers!,1
if you are like me and you love music but don't always know the name of the song or the artist this is the perfect app.  it will tell you all you need to know about the song and how to get it.  Love this and use it all the time.,1
"It worked on my OLD Lenovo Tablet but not my NEW one, with a newer version of Android. A lot of apps on Amazon are failing to keep up compatibility with newer devices. Fix this and I'll raise the the stars!",0
"Tried this because it was free and very disappointed. Much slower to ID a song then SongHound. Uninstalling, rather deal with ads in SoundHound. HTC EVO 4G.",0

If you have to go on Twitter get it. But it is still in the new stage. Very confusing! .,0

@namesping.  New to it but learning.  I would have never used it but entered a contest on The Ellen show with it and won so guess what. I use Twitter now.,1
This service is for people with egos so large that they feel the need to make every thought and action public and the people who love them.,0

This is easy to use. Easy to update with just a tug on the screen. I prefer to use it over the one in my browser.,1
Twitter is fabulous. How are people even allowed to rate this? Everyone knows that its a good app. I was happy I was able to get it on my kindle.,1
Interesting way to follow people you respect and know.Easy way to stay in touch with people's activities and thoughts.,1
doesn't everyone like to tweet and check what everyone else is tweeting? I don't like it as much as Face book but it's fun,1
Amazon is a company that still remembers what customer service is and also that the customer is always right.  I've done plenty of business with Amazon and it's always a positive experience. A few times I've run into a glitch and contacted customer servi,1

I love seeing twitter in such a great app! i love on my kindle fire how on the app the bird looks so clean!,1
It is everything it was advertised it to be. An app for Twitter. It hasn't froze once. And for me that is a big deal.,1
"I use it all the time, but you must choose your friends wisely, then again you must do that everywhere. If your friends are letting you know every time they brush their teeth, you've got the wrong damned friends! The inane and insane should be left alone",1

This app I love word well with kindle fire.  It is a good way to keep up. Is easy to use,1
"I use this more than the website because it's easier to scroll through the feed than on my computer.  The feed stays where I left it, and since I follow a lot of people, it's very helpful in keeping track of what I've seen.  This app is also fully functi",1
easy to access. Excellent App. Easy to use and access is rapid. Links are supported with no problem. One of the best apps to date.,1
If you use Twitter than you almost have to get it for any mobile device you own. It's nice to have a front row seat into the lives of people you may never get to meet.,1

The twitter app work great on all my devices.I can say honestly I would recommend this app to anyone that uses Twitter.,1

I don't really use Twitter but my nieces really like to use it so for that reason I will give it 1 star!,0
I have a few people I like and I follow them and enjoy reading what's going on in their world sometimes.,1
but generally a waste of time.  I find little of relevance to my daily life and I'm discerning in who/what I follow.  Bothered by intrusions from those in whom I have NO interest.,0
I like twitter and this app is easy to use and helpful. Easy to keep up with things in life,1
Have no complaints with this application so far. This is the social media I prefer to use so I am hoping the smooth operating continues.,1
Works wonderfully. It is way better than any other Twitter app I've seen to date. It's smooth and easy to use. Love it.,1

"Makes it even easier to get up and check my twitter. I haven't checked twitter in a little while since #TWD is done right now, but I know I can check it anytime I want now.",1

"I'm just not into Twitter, so I deleted it.  I already spend too much time with Facebook!  Maybe I'll use it later??",0
I could never sign in after I set up my account and posted my first tweet.  It kept sending me to the browser to sign in because it said that my account was suspended.  I tried to sign in in the browser but the security words that it wants you to type in,0
I read it everyday and have no problem with it at all.  But haven't read any for awhile due to lack of time but will resume it soon.  But it is really great to have it on Kindle Fire and easier than iPhone which is much smaller and sometimes hard to read,1
"This app is great. You get to share your news with people, without the intrusive privacy invasions that facebook has recently become. A+ app.",1
This is a well-built app - they anticipated how best to get news and tweets out on the fly. And it's easy to use!,1
I love twitter I have met many new bands and have met many new directioners a I get updates on yours and just about everything,1
Love to use this app. 140 characters or less to state your option. Good to talk about many issues from Breakfast to Immigration. Can even use it ti share pictures of your food.,1

"Twitter is awesome and it works especially great on the kindle fire. I'm on it all the time &amp; sometimes it freezes up but I think that's just my Kindle, not the app. I say get it!!!!!",1
this app does not work well for me. It can barley function and when ever I press on one thing-  it does the opposite.  honestly I do not think you should get this app.,0
"I'm using this to save all of my dates. I always have my Kindle with me, so it's readily available. I like that I can just write with my finger or an electronic stylus rather than typing with the little pop-up qwerty. Less typo's and auto-corrects that w",1
This app helps me when I cannot find a pen...I can just jot down it on here and transfer to my calendar when I get home!!,1
I love this app.  IT the easiest calendar to use. thank you.  ICan easily check it everyday and not miss anymore appointments.,1
Well I was optimistic but I really like it. You can write notes and make it your own. All you have to do is swipe to your right to go to the next month and swipe up to go to the next year over all I love it. they could add more Colors but it's a good app,1
"I have never been the kinda of guy that really ever needed an organizer.  But I started using this app and I like it.All you have to do is click on a day, then add your event.  You just write the event with your finger.  You can choose different colors f",1
"I was looking for a simple calendar, not this. I deleted it because I didn't like how complicated it seemed.",0
"Oh, dear, this is the second calendar app I have tried and I can't figure this one out either. Nothing seems to happen despite my attempts.",0
you wake up and have your day's plan at the tip of your fingers. You will find this app at as a very good planner.,1
I like this app but too much porn ads.I'm a child knowing about porn .it said porn on the ad.,1
This app is pretty much as basic as it gets. I downloaded it for my fire. You can add memos but not much else. I'll keep it until I find one with better functionality.,0
It's not easy to since with email. I would like to use it but since it will not since with my email I can't.,0
"i have been searching for a plain calendar app for free and not one was good. this one is perfect, and simple for my kindle fire.",1
Have several and like them all for various reasons and they are so handy to have right at your fingertips.,1
This app is awesome. It helps me soo much for my daily planning and memos. It helps me get really organized! I would recommend this app. You should get it. I hope my review helped. :),1
This was confusing to use and I simply deleted it rather than fight with it. Often it wouldn't load at all.,0
I like this calendar app.  It is easy to use with the keyboard or handwriting.  Great app to have handy.,1
"This program works excellent on my Kindle Fire, and ""syncs"" nicely with my Google Calendar.  Don't waste your time on the free ones!",1
too hard to use. it was fun to play with but I need to get the business done when shopping,0
After I figured how to use it with the icons and reminders it was great. Its the only calender I use now.,1
"I thought this app would be great, but heck no!!! its so cofuzing and you cant type anything, I wouldn't ever tell a friend about this!!!:( disappointing",0
"It was free.  What more can I say, there are others that are much better.  Needless to say I use another calender now.",0
Installed and uninstalled.  Needs a lot of work and fixs. Hope the developer will take the time to improve on a good base of a program.,0
This is a great app to become more organized. It was really a huge help during high school soccer season and will be more helpful during cheer season! YaY!!!,1
I like this app a lot and its free.  I like to jot down notes sometime to remind to do stuff. It works well with my stylus pen and Kindle Fire. I would recommend this app to others.,1
"I downloaded this calendar to my Kindle Fire. You use your finger to write memos to the calendar after touching the applicable date on the calendar. To go to the next month, slide your finger across the screen. However, I could not find a way to type a d",0
Hated it downloaded because its free deleted it just as fast dont waste your time there are better apps out there.,0
Ads aren't too bad. That quick finger note is not very accurate but works well. Nice quick finger note. Short learning curve - but you need to test.,1
never buy another ringtone again! this app uses the songs already on your phone to allow you to make a custom ringtone from any part of any song. i always hate how the ringtones you buy cut off at weird spots or they never have the best part of the song.,1
This music maker is very simple to work.  You just need music on smart phone or maybe any cell phone and it will make a ringtone a couple of simple move.,1
That was total junk. Never even ended up using it and I sure wouldn't recommend it. Nothing but a waste of time for me.,0
"You can click on any music in your music file on your SD carrd, and pull it into the ringtone maker program. Cut it where you want and then save it as your main ringtone or attach it as the ringtone for a friend. Perfect!",1
Lots of fun making my own ringtones from favorite songs that I have downloaded to my new Galaxy II S. Not hard figuring out the controls. I esp. like being able to clip any part of a song and choosing how many seconds it runs for. You can be very precise,1
I first tried mp3 cutter and ringtone maker!! and was unable to make a single ringtone because it continuously crashed. Then I tried Ringtone Maker and it worked perfectly. It is very easy to use and very fun making and assigning ringtones. LG Optimus G ,1
Best ringtone creator/assigner I've managed to find yet. Does almost everything I need it to. Assigning individual txt tones would be nice...,1
"Why would this app need permission to access protected storage areas of memory,  read and modify contacts,  check network connections.  Way too much access for a simple utility program,  no way I'm installing this app.",0
"I don't know if it was me or the app, but lets just say for posterity's sake, it's not you its me.",0
"I really like this app  Like many apps, it will not let you choose the directory or what you want to do with it.  If it is in the alert directory, then it must be an alert right?So, it works well and I have had a lot of fun with it.  Would love to be abl",1
"This the best ringtone maker/ editor  on Android.Easy functions for cutting /saving/ assigning your preffered tone.Did i mention it is free?.Works with Samsung Galaxy S2 and Ramos w12 tablet.Also tones can be shared by email,bluetooth ,gmail,facebook,etc",1
"I recorded and made personalized ringtones in SECONDS for all my individual idiot coworkers. A shotgun blast for one, Wilhelm Scream for another....LOVE THIS APP!!!",1
"For some reason, only about 1/4 of my songs on my SD card actually show up in the search. I also wasn't able to get it to make one I did find into a ringtone. It did the preview, but never saved it as a ringtone. I have an LG spectrum. It did work for so",0
"I love this easy to use app that helps you customize your ring tone.  I get frustrated when I really like a song, and there is a long musical intro at the beginning of the song. Traditionally on most phones you have to use the ring tone from the beginnin",1
"This app is absolutely fantastic. The app does exactly what I want it to do without any lagging or crashing. Honestly I thought this was going to be another piece of junk, but it works perfectly. I really didn't like the notifications my Kindle Fire came",1
"There's always a question of function when related to the Kindle Fire HD. I was pleased to find there are no issues here. This application delivers what it claims. There doesn't seem to be any bugs as I've ran it. It does sport ads, but they're tolerable",1
I have a lot of fun creating my ringtones from music on my phone with this app. I can make my ringtone as long or short as I want. I can pick just a chorus or verse from a song or a spot in a classical music sequence. Love this app,1
Really easy to use and understand.  Doesn't take a brainiac to make your own ringtones out of any downloaded music.  Quick too.,1
"Knowing that I have a phone that cannot register multiple touches that well (and most other ringtone maker apps rely on it), I love it to death. Does exactly what it says and does it well. Keep up the great work!",1
I got this so that I could use my music on my sd card for alarms and ringtones on new phone.  It didn't work for me.  No instructions and I couldn't get my rings off file. Glad it was free.,0
This app is easy and fun...make clips of music so that its the part of the song that you want by dragging the bars...simple and fun.,1
So so so easy to use to make your own ringtones or other notifications.  Once I got started I ended up making more ringtones than I needed just because it was so fun to use my own music and clip out the snippets I wanted.,1
"Start and stop your ringtone melody wherever you want, then save it. Magnifying the waveform helps pinpoint the exact place you want at the beginning and end. Other reviewers give more details, so I'll just add that I like this app and give it 5 stars.",1
Love this app w what ever song you have on your phone it will tack and you tell it where you want your ringer to start and stop in the song I have get this for 2 phones and would g stir agin,1
This is by far the best app I have downloaded yet. It says what it does and it performs great. It is easy to operate and best of all you can make any sound file your ringtone and edit any song to exactly the ringtone you want!,1
I love that I can take any song and choose any part of the song to cut for my ringtone. You simply play the song of your choice thru this app and take the bars on either side and slide them to what you want to be the beginning and end of your ring tone. ,1
dumb...pointless...and the girls arent even hot. just sticks and bones...at least it was free.( word limit word limit word limit word limit word limit),0
Love it this is a really fun app a good time killer!  The ladies are good looking! Blah blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blah blah blah blah,1
Junk. Doesn't let you see the image but a second. Gameplay of ok though. Image updates would be nice too.,0
Trap balls in a box and reveal the pic beneath. I have played a lot of versions of this game going back to the late 80's and love them. Glad to see the classics don't die. The sexy pics are a plus.,1
"To the idiot that can't read and thought this was a golf game and then gave the app a 1 star because of your failure to read. Pay attention to app descriptions before you download, or don't leave feedback!!",1
Works perfectly on my DroidX.  Used it on my local course which was listed on the courses available (that surprised my a little).,1
I've had this app for over a year at this version. Their web site says they are at version 1.8 (or 2.0..... Hard to tell). I sent an inquiry asking how to upgrade and they told me to buy it from the play store since they can't update it on Amazon. How's ,0

"Don't bother even downloading unless you're a golfer. It does nothing useful off the course. That being said, I can't wait to try this nifty little app out next time I get time to play a few holes!",1
Actually bought this from Google market expecting it to be better than Free Caddie. Almost no courses in Michigan have I found. Stunning considering the number of golf courses per acre here. The web interface to map your own is horrible. It won't use you,0

Cnet been around for some time now and it owned by Discover CBS. You'll get all the up to date in the tech world from some of the best tech personality's in the industry of tech.,1
Figures competing from a sub par review cite we get a bad app. Poor design and most times ads make the app impossible to view. Deleting. The verge is much better  to go to anyway.,0
The CNET news app is a must have for those who wish to keep up with everything happening in the high tech world. I have to monitor my time spent with this app as it's easy to blow 20 minutes reading the articles.EXCELLENT PRODUCT!,1

I like the game. the physics are completely off but that makes it very challenging. you'll spend a lot of trying to find the right combination.,1

Very fun and challenging game. The new levels and unlimited playground modes are well worth the upgrade. Dev is responsive to suggestions as proof by the added  construction materials.,1

Still doesnt have the latest update. i was worried about amazon being able to keep up. its frustrating when the android market keeps reminding you of an update that you have to download here.,1
Makes more sense to buy tapatalk and have access to all your forums rather than getting this buggy piece of work and only being able to access their site.,0
If Amazon would update their apps as quickly as the market with Android does.Tired of the apps not being updated through Amazon,0
Good app. No problems to speak of and it can be fairly challenging. Music is peaceful and can be very relaxing.,1
Great little puzzle game.  I saw another review that didn't care for the music but I love the soundtrack.  It is running flawlessly on both my Droid X and Toshiba Thrive table.,1

Incredibly well done. Very brain straining and fascinating puzzle game. Many many levels and they just keep getting harder. New favorite.,1

hours of entertainment... totally worth $4... good graphics and good game play! can't wait to see what is next up.,1
this app does not work on the galaxy nexus. It freezes on the screen that has 2 panels. Please fix this.,0

"The overall concept of the game seems simple - start at one point, draw a line connecting all squares to a logical endpoint.  And it does have to be to a ""logical endpoint,"" which means a) the game doesn't have a big blinking arrow saying ""end line here!",1

"Unfortunately one star is lowest I can give. What a waste of an app.  No real value,  not the slightest bit entertaining except to those who are 2 years old. With Amazon's special offer to get this for free in feel I spent too much.",0
They say it's a good app for children but it's not I let my son play it right they hacked it and asked him like where's your school where's your home and he told them our adress so they might be coming right now so watch your children playing this app.,0
Had this app last year when we went to Montana on AmTrak.  Had a lot of fun with it when kids were around. Some haters on here just don't get it!  Chill!!,1
If talking to inadamint objects is your thing this app is for you. Slightly more entertaining than watching paint dry. How this app is so popular on market is beyond me.,0
My 5 year old love these apps. It does exactly what the review states. Obviously the people who gave this 1 star didn't read the review and don't have kids. You can also try out the free version to see whether or not you want to buy this app.,1
Spent a couple of hours with my Great Granddaughter playing with &#34;Talking Tom:&#34; love it!!!When I visit she looks forward to taling to &#34;TOM&#34;,1

"People should stop being so anal when rating this app. Its a kids app, that's why kids love it, so If you think the app is stupid there is the reason, rate the app on what the little kids think, my little sisters love this app",1
All it does is repeat what you say to it with a different voice. You can also punch and slap the cat around. So if you have anger issues or you are 2yrs old then this app might be for you.Not hating on just this app. Any app like this one is just as bad.,0
"This is the cutest little guy.  He mimics you and purrs, and a few other cute things.  What a pet, no veterinary bills and no grocery bills.  This little buddy is a great companion anytime.",1
Stupid. Don't waste you're time. This app is not worth a dime. Almost insulting that they charge for this garbage. Not even worth it for free.,0
makes me laugh.  had been wondering about this app for a while.  thanks Amazon .  does what's stated.  works well.  can get annoying but it isn't a game that makes someone want to break their phone in frustration.  good game to make kids laugh.  sat and ,1

"OMG!!!!! You have got to get this app!! It is totally awesome and fun for children!!  My 6 year old boy loves it!  You can record messages and play them (ie: Happy Birthday) and the cat in his cute cartoon voice, says it back!! AWESOME! :)",1
I don't understand why anyone would buy this app.  It's almost a waste of my phone's memory. Poke and speak to the cat which will repeat in an odd voice. Fun for 10 seconds.,0
"Anyone who thinks this is a pointless app obviously does not have a 4 year old. My son loves this and laughs hysterically at it. It gets old after awhile but is worth it while it lasts. Of all the talking-something apps, this one is the best. Large file ",1

"the fart works, but it does not repeat anything i say.  sucks real bad.  deleted 5 minutes after downloading the free paid version.not worth it for free, so do not buy.",0
I really don't understand the point of this app. For something that costs money it should have a lot more functionality. There's a definite lack of creativity.,0

My kids have loved Tom and many of his friends who have similar apps for months. I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from people who are upset that the free app of the day is targeted towards little kids. It's not the app's fault that Amazon,1

"Had a lot of fun playing games with this app. It helped me with my games. Great, great, great app.",1
"As always Adobe works great, easy to use. Havent had any problems at all. Thanks .. What else can I say ?",1
I love this app it makes possible for two of my other apps to word flawlessly. Trouble without it. thanks.,1
ok i like adobe and i whont to get this for my kindle fire hd so amazon needs to get to it so i can get it,0
"Great app! Needed it to run my Flames Live wallpaper. It worked for that. Not sure what else it is helping, but it got the Flames going!",1
"If I understood this, I would probably give it a four.  With some purchases, you need to be very cautious.",0
"performs beautifully on both my HTC Thunderbolt and Motorola Xoom. Adobe is consistently updating the framework to add features. It&apos;s one of the options that makes Android openness superior to Apple&apos;s closed, pay for everything system.",1
I utilze this icon on a constant basis. I would definitely be lost without it. It has proving to be very beneficial and useful at the same time. It have me to be able to processed and use things effectively.,1
Adobe AIR is a pain in the butt. A necessary evil sometimes. But not what I would like to have installed.,0
I have no use for it even though it says I do. What exactly does it do on Coby Tablet? I haven't been able to find out why it doesn't work. I will delete it very soon. Please find out how it helps the mobile equipment work.,0
"All you iSheep flash haters out there quit complaining about it burning battery life.  Update your 1.0 install to the latest version that uses hardware acceleration, and battery life issues go away. Or you can sit around and complain about it (for anothe",1
I would recommend Adobe products as I find them to be most useful and do the things I need to do.,1
"works very well, gives access to all sorts of stuff. I've used this on all my phones/tablets since it became available. there are many reasons not to buy inferior LG or other low end hardware, this is one of them.",1
Another bloated and insecure piece of software from Adobe. It's huge. The performance was lackluster. Fortunately I can remove this Post completely. I wish the same was true of Flash.,0
need this to play certain games and other systems. It works pretty good and takes no time to download for use.,1
would not down load so I did not like it at all it sucks a lot and i am out of words,0
"This uses Flash, which performs terribly, is insecure and chews through the batteries. It&apos;s only used by lazy developers anyway so send them a message by using native apps.",0
"all Adobe products have been great for me. as usual its works great. I have been an Adobe user sense its launch, best way to download and transfer large files.",1
"Don't bother if you're using Virgin Mobile's LG Optimus V, it will not install. Adobe seems lost, the app is a hefty 16mb but does not work on all Android smartphones. Brute force programming, obviously.",0
I couldn't use it on my android for some reason.... For some reason my android was so stubborn on what I could use on that stupid thing....,0
"I would not have bothered downloading this application, but it was required for an application I purchased with real money. I wouldn't be so bothered if I could recieve a refund or if their existed a work around that wouldn't void my warranty, but as it ",0
definately worth getting if you are into flash. you guys with cheap optimus v phones need to stop complaining that your phones cant do anything. rate the app... not your cheap throw away phones,1
Good for my Kindle Fire to view PDFs on them and hey its Adobe how could you go wrong!  Didn't take up much space and a clean install.,1
"I don't use this app at all, but my grandson loves it and plays with it quite often. Was thinking about deleting but he plays with it too often.",1
"I downloaded this talking cat because it was a free app. Although silly, most people can't get enough of him. My 5 year old Granddaughter had fun with it for about a half hour, and people I work with get a great laugh when touching his tail for feet. Thi",1
When I downloaded this app all you could do is pet the cat and hit the cat it didn't do any of the other things it was meant to do.,0
Once again my grandson LOVES this one!  He could not wait to show this one to his daddy! when my grandson laughs it is magical with this it is often!,1
"This is actually a hit with my kids. I bought tablets for my 10 year old son, 7 year old son, and 2 year old daughter for Christmas, and this is one of the things I pre-loaded prior to opening Christmas morning. It was adorable watching them play with it",1
I cast my vote for one of the most useless Apps for 2011!  The quickest app that I have uninstalled from my device for being a waste of time downloading and space on my device.  Did I mention this is a useless app?  1 star as there is nothing lower to gi,0
My boy friend downloaded this for the kids and all the kids do is slap the cat until his falls. qnd the noise gets so annoying geez!,0
"I downloaded this app so I could play with it with my young niece and nephew. Once I opened it, I quickly realized that in order to use the app, add-ons had to be purchase. Not cool.",0
This game is so cute and fun I love singing into it and playing. I also have found my cats love it when I meow into it and then he mocks it back. They will come running to where I am. Great idea! 5 stars. No flaws really for what it is.,1
I think this is so cute and perfect for stress relieve! It is adorable. Everyone loves playing with this and the voice is super sweet!,1
Ok I was putting my kindle next to the speaker of my Tv then Tom started to repeat what the characters in CHOWDER are saying,1
"But he can be a pain, I don't know who's schedule he is on but it is not mine. Really cute and fun to play with. Getting the points was kind of hard till I got someone to show me to press on everything and I do mean everything.",1
"this one kept my grandchildren ages 4, 2 and 1 entertained for about an hour and us all laughing when he talked back at us.",1
"I love knocking the cat down and making it say funny things, and recording them for later. I think you would like it too.",1
Fun & silly.  Good when you need a laugh.  Very cute and a good way to make someone laugh when they need a good laugh.,1
"This is the old version of Talking Tom! You need to put on all of the other talking friends apps on the Amazon App Store. For example Talking Tom 2, or Talking Been, or Tom & Been News. Thoes are my favorite apps on my mom's iPad, but I want them on my K",0
"This is a fun app for kids, if you want to hear them laugh from the bottom if their hummus, this is the app!",1

My 5 and 3 year old kid loves this app. They love hearing Tom repeats everything they say and copy their laughs as they play with this app. It is a good time killer for the kids.,1

my nephew downloaded this game He played around with it for a while but I felt the image a bit too weird to tolerate it.  a cyber pet.. Hell no.,0
I got this for my 3& 1/2 yr old granddaughter and she absolutely LOVES it!!! She loves these types of things on the Kindle.,1
oh yeah--lot of fun creating your own messages to people and having to act out and record in his voice what you say. then email to friends for them to enjoy.  a must have for tablet or mobile. hilarious what you can get this cat to do and say.,1
Got this for my grand son and what surprise when it began to talk .  He had no idea that it would do that .  Laughed and Laughed,1
"I just love this app...... puts a smile on your face because it is so crazy, my grandson just LOVES IT!!!!!",1
Stupid game. Waste of time. Wish would never down loaded it. absolutely the worst I ever down loaded What were you thinking?,0
I can trust time more then I can trust any of my other friends. He does not ask to borrow money and not pay it back. He does not borrow things and not bring it back. Last but not least he won't talk shut about you behind your back,1
My youngest daughter absolutely loves this!!!  Keeps her occupied for a really long time.  It's funny listening to this and the kids will certainly be entertained.,1
"My great granddaughter learned to call her grandmother Me Maw , I kept repeating it to Tom and she would smile and say it after he did .",1
"A lot of laughs.  I love his little face, so expressive.  Kids love this app and it is free, a big plus!",1

"It seems that anytime I order an app online with Amazon, I never receive them in the cloud as promised.  Talking Tom Cat is one of those apps.  When I search for the app on my kindle, it is not available.  Fortunately, it's free.",0
Talking tom is one of the highlight of my day and I love when whenever I say something he says it in a much higher pitch,1

I got this app for my son who as soon has it on his iPod.  Their actions are funny and cute!,1
"This will NOT work on a Kindle Fire!  The Kindle Fire doesn't have a Microphone, therefore you can't talk to Tom, which means he can't repeat anything you say!  It would have been nice if Amazon had mentioned that this game is only for Cellphones (with M",0
"This is definitely for pre-school age kids. It is so silly that I am sure the little folks will giggle. For anyone age seven and above, I think they will find it pure silliness. However it was free and easy to delete.",0
"This app is great for keeping your grandchildren entertained for short periods of time, especially when they are 2 years old.",1
Do not get this app. It is really bad for children! I showed this to my daughter thinking she would like this but later that night she told me that she was having nightmares about it! I would give it zero stars if I could because this ruined my poor daug,0

I like to play with this app and my kids do to.Great fun for the price and hey I haven't deleted it so it must be good enough.,1
"i thought this would be fun, but i could not get him to do what the description said he would do, and it was just dumb.",0
"My children love this app, the kids interact with the cat. You can feed the cat milk, it purrs when petted, you can hit it on the head, and it falls over. The cat listens and mimics what you say, my children think it is hilarious.",1
"This is something we had to get. Saw it on my sister's ipad a few years ago, and luckily it works the same way on my son's new Kindle.",1
This game is a waste! I thought that it would be fun cause my friend has this app and it was so fun! But this game is not for any kindle! First of all....it does t even repeat what I say! And when I try to do an action I apparently have to pay for more f,0
There is a new hacker and Tom says where do up live and he records your every move. Stay safe and don't get this app and if you have kids who play it DELETE IT NOW!!!,0
.... weird. It wants me to buy Stuff. Don't get this app unless you want to buy things for 99 cents like food.  The only things you can do is Give Tom milk and a few more boreing things.  Sweat talking puppy funny dog is way better.  I give this app 1 st,0

My grandkids just love slapping this poor cat and instead of crying for my phone and running the battery down I let them have the kindle until they get tired or the cat just doesn't get back up.  LOL,1
My kids convinced me to let them download this app and we were very disappointed. It doesn't offer anything unless you choose to pay for additional options. I will be removing this app.,0
"What a cute sad little face.  However, it is fun to play with little kitty during a break at work. If you give it a name the fun is even greater.",1
even the free version is really cute and the kids enjoy it. i purchased the full version since my kids enjoy the free version so much. fun and worth it,1
"If you're having a bad day, just fire up Tom and he'll have you laughing again. I love his sqeaky voice and being able to record the videos and upload them to fb or send them via email. If you try to talk too fast it doesn't grab all of the words. My dau",1
Laughter is the best medicine and it makes me laugh when he repeats my words.  Sometimes he might miss some though.,1
you need to download so many different things to play this game its not that great really you r wasting your time with this one,0
who could ask for more?  This is a silly app and I don't really understand it but everyone in my house thinks it's so funny.  I see everyone (including the adults) playing with it.,1
This might entertain a three year old for a few minutes but even that's pushing it. The 'free' version is crippled beyond belief.  You're expected to pay for almost every feature. Don't waste your time.,0
I love when u talk to him and he's like a translator so please please please buy talking Tom the cat,1
this is kinda funny to play with. what more can be said download it play it if you don't like it erase it (got to love free things),1
"My granddaughter loves this cat. We play together, wish there was more free stuff that you don't have to buy in order to get things for Tom cat.... :(",1
"DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL, IT ONLY DOES A FEW THINGS IF YOU WANT MORE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT",0
There aren't enough nice things that you can do with this cat. You can make it purr a little but mostly its geared toward punching and hurting the cat. The interaction is too violent and promotes laughing at hurting an animal. Disgusting.,0
"I got this app thinking that it would be fun,but Tom wouldn't repeat anything! Pointless putting it on the Amazon store if it doesn't work for kindle!",0
"This was a horrible app for the kindle Fire!it froze up my kindle Fire  and he would not even talk!if u r looking for this app for the kindle Fire,don't buy it!",0
My great niece loves Tom....not as much as Ben...I don't know why....kids. they like what they like and that's all it is.,1
"Fun for the whole family.It's a fun App, love the copy cat voice, the kids love playing with it",1
I love this game it is so fun I luv making it fall down its so funny Andy some people think that it's a wast of time but it's not it is awesome for kids my whole family Luca it (Thanks Tom),1
"Just a way to sell you add-ons. I suppose it could be considered cute, (Ben the dog is better)But it is a thinly disguised vending machine for in-app purchases.",0
This is so much fun the whole family can enjoy. The kids get the most out of it when he repeats what they say.,1
I love my talking Tom cat. My son has it & i found it very funny. Lots of laughs & lots of fun!,1
I love this cat! He has the cutest voice! I use this app to wake my son up in the morning. Just talk into your kindle and tom repeats whatever u say but in a way cuter voice.,1
This application was very laggy and very slow. The cat would move it's mouth with a delay of a few seconds for any words.,0
I play this with my grandkids and I don.t know who enjoys it more! It just makes you laugh. There is no thinking required.,1
This is such a cute app.  I could hardly get my phone out of my grandson's hands because he had so much fun with it.  It's fun for adults too.,1
This  app  is  the  worst  I've  ever  downloaded  it  stinks. It  is  so  boring  all  you  can  do is  tap  things.,0
Doesn't work that great on my Kindle fire. What a bummer as my young kids get a laugh out of it.,0
"When u need to break tension or make the kids laugh this is great, really like it when children smile and laugh",1
Tom cat is very funny & entertaining. You will keep the attention of any crowd. This can be used for all ages.,1
Talking Tom is better than the other apps. He's been a brilliant idea of a game. This free download has  hilarious cat.,1
Not worth the time loading....can't do anything but make the cat purr and knock him out. I would recommend you pay for this one so he will do more than two things. I was disappointed.,0
I have seen other people have this and it's as funny as can be.. but it didn't work on my KindleFire HD.. nothing! at least it was free.,0
It's great what I really like is how you can make videos and upload it to anything I uploaded my first one,1
I love the app but I am not sure if I like the original one or the 2nd one! So please comment me on witch one you think is better!,1
TALKING TOM WILL NOT DOWNLOAD ON MY KINDLE FIRE DEVICE. MY DAUGHTER HAS IT ON HER I PHONE AND I THOUGHT IT TO BE VERY FUNNY.,0
it works on my kindle fire but it DOES NOT FREAKING TALK TO ME!talking ginger is better. U HAVE TO BUY STUFF TO HAVE MORE FUNthis app sucks so much!!!!!!!!!!do not download!!!!!,0
doesn't do that much...amusing for the first minute or so.  I will probably delete this app in another week or so.,0
"My kid still plays with this app from time to time. She loves the noises reactions, and the way Tom Cat repeats everything she says. Great app for kids.",1
"So funny, we love it all of us do.  This little cat is so funny! We tell everyone about this funny tom cat all of us play with this cat all the time!",1
GAME NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY ON MY D2 PAD.  HAD TO DELETE IT... ... ... .... ... .... ... ... ...,0
My grand children love this app and play it a lot. I am very happy with it would recommend it.,1
When I talk to Tom he just sits there doing nothing not good for the kindle fire THIS APP SUCKS,0
Just a fun app to play around with and pass time - it is just fun and funny-I like it,1
Fun and cute for my daughter! Good for young ages! I believe K thru 2nd graders would love this Tom Cat!,1
Always fun to go back to this guy once in awhile.  Him and his friend apps are always there for a silly laugh with friends from time to time.,1
My two year old loves this! It doesn't get old for her and we share lots of laughs over it. It does just what is described. She loves knocking the cat down. It is helping her learn to talk as well!,1
"It's fun, grandkids love it.  He s cute, like all the different things he does.  Entertaining and they get a good laugh out of him.",1
This app is for my granddaughter and she loves to play with and really make her laugh when she is playing with it.,1
it's very fun and good. super fun to record and play with when bored. this is super great love it!!,1
It is so much fun to see this cat talking and complaining when you touch it is great.  It gives the impression that is real.,1
"I have an iPhone and loaded the talking Dodo bird on it because my 3 year old lives it. I got tired of him constantly getting my phone, so I bought him an Android Tablet for Christmas so he had his own device and could play with it anytime he wanted. Yes",0
"This download was the worst one yet. What on Earth is the fun in tapping a screen to punch a cat? Sure, I hate cats, too, but someone spent time on this? Try turning the hatred towards pesky felines into something more productive. &quot;Cat Drop Soup&quo",0
Amazon should mention that this app will not talk on the Kindle Fire.  I looked like an idiot talking to my Kindle expecting a response.  I will be deleting this app.,0
Most annoying app ever.  I can't believe I actually even downloaded this.  As soon as I opened it and used it once I deleted it.,0
It is hilarious!  My grandkids and nieces love it! Very entertaining!I would recommend this app to anyone with small or not so small kids!,1
"Said I'd have to reload, but we were able to get Tom 2 instead. I'm not sure if the reason it didn't load is my fault or not.",0
Enjoy myself and great for grandchildren who thoroughly enjoy it!,1
"When we're talking about this game, anything is better! I downloaded it for my daughter. I failed to see any warning sign that this would be a depressive game that requires you to torture the animal to get responses. I found it cruel and hateful. I wasn'",0
This app works great!  I use it to entertain my three yr old.  He loves it!  He has even figured out how to make videos with it.,1
I didn't feel it was appropriate for my children. Some of the things were ok but others werent. I have deleted it.,0
this app is cute and funny. all my friend's laugh and thought it was cute. it's a good conversation app to get.,1
How cute this is.  This cat talks to you and he is funny.  He purrs and does all kind of funny things.  Nice when you need a cute laugh.  Easy to operate and has a kids mode and adult mode.,1

fun for the whole family. The cat repeats everything you say and the hubby & kids have a blast with this app,1
I think it's great so much fun. My mom has it on her phone too. I have so much fun on it. It is fun for everyone.,1
Bests kids app ever a little annoying but F-U-N fun you need to buy this app I love it tom ( the cat ) is so funny he says what you say you can step on his toe punch him pull his tail and much much more he makes me LOL best:),1

this app is too funny. having lots of fun with it and other people. everyone needs to laugh. buy this app for some laughs.,1
This game is entertaining! My cousin (2 yrs old) loves to play it and is obsessed with the kitty :3 good for kids and up.,1
This is my favorite app to use for navigating and editing files on my Android phone. I highly recommend this app to anyone who appreciates good utilities made with integrity. I have not found 1 bug while heavily using this app for many years.,1
"This is certainly the gold standard for an effective app.  The UI is not beautiful, but it is not clunky and cluttered either.If the dev was aiming for an uber-functional and flawless app that simply does what it should and does it perfectly, he hit his ",1
This handy app really gets to the Root of the issue especially if you have bloated apps that take up valuable resource and space. Bear in mind you do need to be Root to benefit from this app!,1
"Excellent file manager app! Even the free version is great, and all you need if not rooted!",1
"Must have, only way to truly customize your phone and use all of the accessible storage space on the internal memory.Best money I hand spent on a app",1
very good so much,1
Awesome app. I use it a lot. Root is very useful and this app can be used for so many things. Even if u aren't rooted yet this is a good file manager to use. In most cases you can browse the root of your phone and even copy from but not delete the files ,1
"This is the very best root file manager with a very clean ui and tons of essential features, i would recommend this app to anyone. I also recommend getting this devs app &quot;SQLite&quot;, its another must have app:)",1

Very versatile and fast - the best for Android I've seen so far. A strong recommendation for gettings this app if your device is rooted and you need a solid file manager.,1
"This is the best application for navigating, modifying, and organizing your rooted Android device. Solid performance with a familiar interface.",1
If you want access to the file system on your android device this is it.  I am using it on my kindle and it is awesome.,1
"I have this tool on both my Nook Color &amp; Galaxy Tab.  You need this for all those little tweets to keep your rooted device running smooth.  I found that there is a small learning curve, but once learned you can&apos;t live without it.",1
I needed this to install the supposedly pre-installed Google Store/Google Play that my tablet shipped with.  Works well and has yet to disappoint.,1
"Having this app already, I must say that this app should come with every Android phone. Easy to use interface and straight to the point. 5/5 stars!",1
Anyone with a rooted phone will find this is the most awesome file manager out there. You can even see and edit the contents of a database file. Keep up the good work!,1
I use this on my Kindle to get around Amazon's stupid restrictions. It works really great and has allowed me to access the Google Play Store and actually get some good apps (unlike Amazon's... yikes).,1
Most useful app I've purchased so far. If you want to get the most out of your Android phone then this is a must have after you obtain root for your phone. Simple and intuitive to use. Thanks to the dev for putting this up on Amazon. Saves us Google Apps,1

I'm so tired of just sitting there.All thee is is just stupid stuff and your just going back and fourth.BORING,0
"Addictive and fun games. As with most games, attention span for me is one week. And then I play once in a while. This game needs no manual, no reference cheat sheets. so I like the fact that this is simple and clean. My daughter enjoys it too.",1
this game doesn't have any fun to it. I mean I got bored in just a second. They also need to make the levels shorter. I would not recomemd this game to anyone who likes REAL fun.,0
"The controls didn't work right on my galaxy tab, it acted like it was always tilted one way and wouldn't go the other way. Frustrating to say the least. otherwise it seems ok.",0
I mean mantel it shut down my kindle and I had to wait for the battery to run down but most of the time it also,1
I am giving this game five stars because everyone that has written a review can not spell for crap. Which means this game might be above their intelligence.,1
Worst game I have ever played. Wast of time the ball falls super slow and the levels are freakishly long.,0
ewwwww this game is awful. It put me to sleep. donor buy this lame exuse they call a game read the comments this game ducks.,0
Sometimes it is nice to have an app where no thinking is required and anyone from the very young to the very old can play,1
I loved it on my old ipod but unfortunately. it broke but then I got my kindle and Mt favorite game ever!!!!!!,1
this game sucks so bad all you do is tilt it sometimes the tilt does not even work this game isn't worth your time,0
I at first thought when I first saw the pictures of this game it was going to be one of those cheesy old time arcade games. but when I played it I fell in love with it. plz do get this app.,1
when ever I go it always makes me force close the app and I cant play the app at all I try downloading again and it still doesn't work when I download the app again,0
"I first looked at the app reviews and one of them asked why it had four stars because they thought it was terrible.Then I saw a lot of other reviews about it being the best app ever, so I wasn't really sure what to exspect. Anyway, the app is fun and is ",1
"A very nice little draw/paint program. Even has an undo button, unlike a lot of free drawing programs.A good selection of brushes.If you want a nice little doodling program then give this a try.It would help if those who review Android apps would indicat",1
"It was an ok drawing app until it froze the background color.  It has the basic brush types (round, square, spray etc.) You can choose colors and sizes for your brush. However,  when I tried to change the background color it froze on the third color choi",0
Even the kids have a good time with this one no matter how old they are. Take it to appointments with you. I guarentee you won'thave to wait. When ever you have something to do and aren't bored it seems like they take you in right away. Try it.,1
this is agreat game i find myself stuck to it awesome its a great time saver i love it don't hate on this app,1
When I tried it the first time I thought it is not hard so I was on the part where you have to press red white blue and green I pressed the colored letters and I lost but then I tried it a different yay and still did not work so I stopped playing this ga,0
I dislike this app because it is not very funny.  It's not even to see if you are smart. I think any app would be better than this. Now you know why it's FREE.,0
"got past first level and then got stuck! no matter what I do, it doesn't let me past that question! don't wast time or memory on this thing! :/HOPEFULLY THIS WAS HELPFUL",0
this game is so stupid! if u bother to get this.. u will regret it and delete. so don't get it and save 20 mins of your life.,0
"I only got this because I didn't want to spend money for the moron test. The game has almost all of the same questions as the Moron test, and it looks like these people did this on word 1997 there are no pictures or any background its just unapealing. Th",0
I completed the game but it was very challenging. A game like this deserves 5 stars even though it was short.,1
when I read the reviews I thought that cant be that bad but it is so don't get but nobody is going to stop you,0
after the 6:45 clock don't press the arrow that says checkpoint instead look for the next written to the side of the screen in small letters press that and you go on to the next question which is not a repeat question I hope this was helpful,1
This game is not fun at all!!!! After about 10 questions this was uninstalled. I think the Moron test is way better. I would rate this a zer0 if I could. Boringest game EVER!!!!!!!,0
I finished the app so I know what to do. At the white screen were it says FINISH. Press it. I know it says that  u failed but it's a trick. On the right hand corner in red but really tiny it says FINISH.then u have finished the game. YOUR WELCOME,1
"This seems like its supposed to be good but its soooooooo not. pathetic copyoff of moron test (which is actually good. moron test, that is)",0
The game is the same every time. There's 4 or 5 questions that you have to answer. You loose every time. I know  this because me and my sister did a test on it.,0
I was playing this app and I acidently hit back and it made me restart so I did but then it kept saying I got the Answer wrong when I gave the same answer as before.Bad app. and as said before copy of Morin test.,0
okay I know this might be really stupid and I am a loser soooo the first stupid question kept on calling me a loser.  I HATE THIS GAME SSSSSOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!,0
"I enjoy this app and i have no idea why so many people cannot figure it out. Yes, it takes some OBSERVATION of every screen you meet and maybe some patience, it is still possible to beat the game if you are smart enough. It will call you a dummy until yo",1
It's. horrible! I didn't get it Cu's I read that it was a total ripoff. it's a copycat and boring game!! just remember that u not a moron or idiot or a loser cuz that game is a total lie and copier justso u no!!!!!,0
THIS GAME SUCKS. ITS JUST A COPYCAT OR THE MORON AND STUPID TESTS. DON'T BUY IT ITS JUST A WASTE OF YOUR KINDLE SPACE,0
How do the finish to finish is when it says loser there's a finish in the corner you wok n lol,1
I played it until I got to the press number six page I couldn't get it it's also a copy of the first game the Moran test and the stupid test also its calls you loser if you fail!  Deleted it with a hour of use. Do not get this app,0
So cool and funny is like your in funny town my life is so cool with this thing us ha,1
this app is fun if you have nothing to do. i have beat this app so i decided to test my friends! this app will get you hooked and you wont want to stop until you beat it.,1
this app is plain and a rip off of the moron test it just looks like something a child made AWFUL APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU LIKE STUPID GAMES thank you,0
"The game is interesting.... for five minutes. Then, you get a question wrong, it says &quot; LOSER! YOU FAIL!&quot; and then you have to start over. And when I say start over, I don't mean start the level over. I mean THE WHOLE GAME! then, you have to do",0
This WIDGET is all I need........................................................)............... Get it it is a widget and not an ape I hope all the people that complain of not opening know how to operate a smart phone,1
I use this app every day. It's a very convenient app since I keep it on my desktop. I highly recommend it.,1
"This app did nothing for me.  In fact, i deleted it pretty soon after installing it.  Sorry to the developer that i can't say anything positive.",0
"I got this because the icon says 76%, not rounded to the lower tenth, however the widget only shows remaining life in increments of ten. Very misleading.",0
I keep the icon on my main home screen so I can easily control GPS and WIFI. Also shows what apps and tasks use the most battery.,1
does exactly what it claims and is far more accurate than stock battery icon in the corner (galaxy tab). often my stock battery icon will show full battery all the way down to 80% or so but this shows you how much you actually have.,1
"This does what it promises to do and is a simple and small widget. Not sure why all the haters gotta hate, if you don't like the permissions then don't load the app. It works just fine for me!",1
"Installed it so i could have a visual as well as a numerical display of remaining battery but it doesn't refresh, i plugged my phone up to the charger and completely charged it but the widget showed it was still charging and only at 56%, uninstall lg est",0
I know you can dig around in settings to find out the amount of battery remaining and what is using up your power. But to know your usage at a quick glance is beneficial. This does not tell you what is using up your power but will give you a snapshop of ,1
Just what i needed.  i dont know why there is no option to display battery life percentage on the Android os.  the little green battery that changes to orange isnt very useful,1
I've used this app in my last two smart phones. These new Smart phones take so much power and most times need recharging befor the end of the day. This app keeps you up to date on the battery status. Recommend to all.,1
why does a battery indicator require my gps location how crazy is this bull crap if you think about it.,0
This is the first app I've ever downloaded that I wasn't able to open in the year that I've had this phone. Lame. HTC Incredible 2.2 Froyo.,0
"not only does this application not work, but it occludes important safety issues surrounding xray use from the public, which is a real travesty. this app should be removdd from the app store",0
SHOWED THESE TO FRIENDS MOST OF THEM GOT FOOLED BUT ONE ****** GUY CAUGHT THE TRICK LOL NICE FOOLIN APP.,1
Did you even look at the description? &quot;Prank&quot; and &quot;joke&quot; doesn't make sense to you? Let me know when you decide to go back to kindergarten and learn to read.,0
This was not as good as it appeared.  A waste of my time to download and navigate.  I deleted it as soon as I got it.,0
I tried many ways to get it to work for me but it didnt. So I say that you should be careful getting it,0
Why does this game have two stars overall? It should have on e it doesn't even move where u move it! Horrible game doesn't show my foot either!,0
This app doesn't let you scan yourself. It's an app to prank your friends. When I talked to the creator of this app he said that he wanted an app that lets you prank your friends with an X-Ray. I asked him why didn't he make an app that actually works by,0
Corny. Now I don't know how to uninstall it. Can someone help me please ? Kids might could fool each other once with it.I really dont want this on my phone. How do I get it off? No uninstall button.,0
this app does nothing. it has no point and doesn't work. It is a waste of time and space! I recommend you don't get this app,0
"very poor quality, only 2 body parts to choose from. hard to scroll because of bad sensitivity to movement. needs work first then could be a three star app. evo 4g",0
"This is so lame I was pointing it at the ceiling then pressed left, and right foot,right hand, and left hand but it still showed the hand even though I wasn't pointing at it.",0
Should have listened to the other reviews.  This is just plain dumb.  I can understand it's meant as a joke and it can't actually xray.  But it doesnt even pull that off properly.  Any time u spend downloading is just time you will never get back and wis,0
I hate this app it's just a pic of a X-ray hand and that's it awful app :( awww man I have to keep writing done well bye,0
"When I tried to play it, it didn't even move. A waste of my space is all it is to me",0
"This app sucks OK so today is October 6 2013 Sunday and I broke my finger TuesdayOctober 1 and it still has not healed well it says my finger is perfectly fine. Oh and get this, xrayed my foot and it says there are three joints in my big toe m and I did ",0
Not even a real app to tell you the truth. Its not worth anyone's time.I would delete this app from my memory if i could thats how bad it is.,0
FYI we all read the description and we knew it was a prank app. I tried it on all my friends and NONE OF THEM FELL FOR IT. So yeah this app is defiantly not my favorite.,0
RIP OFF. Don't think it's gonna scan anything. All it does is let you look at the foot or the hand. And it's some other persons hand or foot. Ok well just dont get it,0
"This app is only for entertainment. Plus it is a waste of time for using your Amazon coins for silly reasons to scan FAKE prints. This may be for children like -4 but otherwise, it's still, don't waste Amazon coinsStay cool :D",0
well i haven't even tried it out yet but from all of yalls reviews i really don't know so wish me good luck!!!,0
"with all the bad reviews and having only one star, how can this possibly be in the top 100, let alone number 16. I don't get it.",0
what kind of a crap game is this it sucks big time man DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!? DEAD SERIOUS RETARDED. THIS DOESENT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR,0
Guys you think It is stupid. Wow. It is to prank your friends I mean read the description. First read description you think you guys are so cool judging an app make a better one then if you think this one sucks,1
THIS app (says in the beginning)its an illusion not an actual xray scanner.also its for people to prank others and you can only pretend scan your right hand or left foot! talk about SUPER LAME..might wanna mention this application!!!,0
"Looks pretty fake, but it's actually kind of cool. More of a one time app. Not really going to go back to it much, since it's just a silly app.",1
This is horrible.  The ads are so big you can't even play with it.  The graphics are fuzzy.  The calibration is a joke.  Just a poor app.  Even at free it is no good.,0
its pretty weak... the calibration is off and it is just a waste of time. won't entertain anyone at a party. unbelievable. just plain sucks.,0
IT DOES NOT WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WILL NOT SHOW U UR HAND WILL SHOW U A RANDOM X-RAY OF SOMEONE ELSE'S!!!!,0
"Unless I missed something, I don't find any practical use for this item except maybe have a laff or to.Not for me.",0
"This game Was not fast enough.  Did not like it, so didn't play it.  Nothing else to say on this subject.",0
This isn't real and it really doesn't work so I say don't get this app it sucks like crap and I thought it would actually work,0
i loaded it and pranked my geniuos son even. i am going to have fun with this one. takes about 5 mins of practice to mater all the tilting. i did it zig zaging like i was scanning. I even yelled yo hold still. lol,1
Pointless. Not realistic at all. Nothing good to say about this one. I guess you have to be into this sort of thing.,0
My kids love it. It is fun to play with. It would be better if it had kid size on it.,1
This is the worst app ever all that you can do is scan your right foot or your right hand. I don't even think that was my hand. :(:(:(:(:(,0
I just got this as interest.. it didn't last long and just wasnt that cool to play with so it is gone,0
I tried to scan my hand and it is fake and my foot but it won't let me so I can scan my hand,0
This app is a total waste of your time. The free version sucks just like the one for $.99. It's a rip off take my advice and don't waste your time,0
It was horrible my 5 yr. old brother knew it was fake from the beginning...it moves.on its own I don't recommend.it,0
I hate this app it the worst one in the world I wish I could remove it from all you good peaple it SSSSSUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!,0
It sucks. How do you scan your hand? All it has is a picture of a hand and tilt it. Deleting it now. Never download it. It sucks.,0
not worth downloadin. simple crap and not gonna convience your friends. doesnt show whole as shown photo. doesnt do as descibed. removd app within a minute from downloading,0
"it is a prank app that half the time you cant get into. DO NOT BUY, IT IS A WASTE OF STORAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"was stupid and didn't work, my son downloaded this to try and he didn't even like it so we uninstalled it",0
Not a X-ray A Scanner Just A Picture Of A Skeleton Hand With You Tilting Your Device Diffrent Ways To See More Of It Not Ya Hand In fact My Kindle Fire's Camra Was Looking At My Face It's A Rip Off Even Tho It's Free Because It Takes Up Space The Bought ,0
"Downloaded for a laugh, didn't think it would actually work (it doesn't, app even tells you on startup that its not real, which is fine). The problem is the calibration on the thing is off, I was tilting my phone all over the place and nothing was workin",0
This game is boring and I don't recommend that you get this game. This game is super LAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Love Victoria,0
"slow startup, then once you select your options, the screen goes black and locked my phone up! had to remove battery. not a well written app.",0

"This is the funnest and Greatest Apps i have tryed so far. The downside is it's $4.99. but to me it's so worth it to see what you can create and see how much you can sell it for. it's a must buy! dont listen to the other comments, cause im telling you th",1

You should be ashamed. Although it's clear you have no morals and are unable to feel shame. I too will avoid your apps from now on; you've been added to the list.,0
You can't do anything but shape clay on the wheel and fire it. You have to buy everything else to decorate it. Total rip off!!!!!!,0
I don't  know why everyone hates this game it's  awesome not bad. i don't  get why you can't  just get everything with the game though.,1
"This game was fun at first. But when I was making my 3rd pot, my kindle suddenly froze. I had completely restart my kindle. If this is fixed, the game is really fun and I will give it 5 stars!",0
This game is wonderful even better since I got it free during app of the day I highly recommend this!,1
So many people have ready said it... IAP for paid app is just ridiculous...especially when said app is $5! And from what I've read this dev has one of those tricky tricky business models that sold this app as premium with all content and then pulled an u,0
"I have seen this game from infinite dreams for some time now,  but the $4.99 price was kept me away. For a FAOTD this was a great surprise! I haven't set down my phone since I downloaded this game. Make a piece,  sell it,  and buy more colors and materia",1

But Infinite Dreams needs to update it and add more because they've lost their base fans.  Most people aren't going to pay $5 for an app.  I see a lot of opportunity to work around that.  Even though everyone will complain about ads there's a better chan,1
The product description states explicitly that there are real money spending options in this app. And that parents can limit & control that through menu settings. NO such menu is accessible from within this app's menu on a Kindle Fire! So be forewarned y,0
I fell in love with this app over a year ago on my ipod and I am so happy it works great on my Kindle Fire! I also love being able to post my creations on to my Idreams community page so even after I sell them I still have them and can show them off!! GR,1
"I LOVE THIS! it is so unique! there are always things to do! there are quests that give you inspiration when youve run out! its like nothing else ive ever played! i am so glad that i got this when it was free, but it is worth the money others have to pay",1
"Here we go again, more and more greedy developers everyday. Why would anyone sell you anything incomplete is just wrong. Charge one fee and make both you and the buyer happy. Greed is evil!! Not recommending this app to anyone and i hope your ratings go ",0

This was a wonderful free app of the day. I have seen some reviews that you may have posted and I found out how to paint the pot and add decorations. Paint: Slide your finger up and down the pot. Slide it on the same spot again to make it darker. Brushes,1
This game is one of my favorites really it is so if u like creating unique and cool pottery this is for you! I would definetly not listen to the haters this game is 1 everybody should get! 5 stars,1
I could not open it. You can do it for real in the first place. I think it was very stupid. Please do not get this app it is not worth it at all.,0
"This game is great for future artists. People who enjoy pottery will really like this game. As you sell more pots and earn more money, you can unlock more.",1

Really? Again? In app purchases? Here let me give you a star and feel free to use it as a suppository.,0
"I thought I'd hate it, but since it was featured as a free app today, I snagged it. I probably wouldn't pay for it, but it is incredibly fun. I can't put it down. I can see myself purchasing the add-ons though. It makes me want to make real pottery.To pe",1
This is a pretty robust app that can be played in relatively short bursts. I don't plan on using the in app purchases and haven't needed to. anyone complaining about IAP has obviously not tried the game at all and has no concept of how developing and mar,1
totally fun! I don't even know how to get the in app purchases but this app works fine without it,1
"I like this app. It is fun to play and very relaxing. I have finished the app twice, and am waiting for an update.",1
"This review is just to balance out the fake 5-star reviews put on by the greedy devs. But then, a $5 app which wants you to keep spending even more in-app deserves zero stars.",0
I think that this game is the best game that's ever been invented and I love this game and I play it everyday,1

I got this app on my kindle fire and it works great. I didn't have any problems or glitches or anything. its pricey but I think its worth it for the hours of fun it gave me.,1
"I grabbed this as the faotd a while back, and I don't regret it at all. I enjoy the game as a way to relax, and be creative at the same time.My 4 year old loves this game too, and creates some amazing stuff. The only complaint I have is that my 4 year ol",1
I think that this app is great. It is very fun for people who love art. It also gives you a lot of selections of how you want to create your pottery. Get this app it is great. (Written by my granddaughter),1
this game is so fun u need to get this game now I got this game for free but if I didn't then I would still pay 5dollars for this game this game is great,1
this game is a very good time killer and it is very. fun!!! you should get it because it gets your imagination out!,1
its so much fun its like u have ur own pottery business don't listen to the bad reviews get it.,1
Just because its going to premier as FAOTD does not mean that you must cripple your app's rating by charging more. Treat a FAOTD as a time to get people to try your app and raise your rating. Think of the future not the present. Now no one will buy your ,0
I love potery so now i dont have to waite so long for it to come out and i can be me. it may seam like a wast of money and time but it is fun when yu play it alot.,1
it is annoying sell the app for more money then don't sell for 4.99 then raping customers for more money afterwards,0
I don't see anything wrong with this game. So I don't know what's up with everyone saying crap about it. I love it. Its very addicting and it sure does kill time.,1
I love this app so much its so fun I play it every night!! you got to get this!! what this app is about you make pottery!! you make the shape then you color it and more!!!!,1
"It is so exciting to create pottery that you wouldn't go out and do. The option to sell it is awesome. What a great, fun pass time.",1
"What a fun, relaxing and entertaining activity this is.  I am so tired of all the hack n slash, tower defense, city builder, match three, hidden object, boring word games, games that offer no creative challenge, no opportunity to stretch your imagination",1
"I really don't understand the IPA hate. It doesn't make the game any less fun, and that's what a review is about. This game makes incredible use of the touch screen. It can be as simple or complex as you'd like it to be. It actually got me interested in ",1
Started Out Free Then This App Stopped Working.. Said I Need To LOg In To Amazon To Fix. ThenI Seen That They Are Making You Pay To Play...  Even If You Unlocked Items...  Idiotic Business Model.. Way To You Customers Off And Get A Bad Rep.  I Let My 4 Y,0
"I don't know what problems everyone else is complaining about, but I love the game. Cute concept and fun to play. Not too hard and not too easy. If you don't want to spend real money on the IAP, then don't. Duh.",1
So far the app is pretty good and ranks between a 4 and 5 star app. When and if I find the In App Purchases I will no longer use the app and delete it from my Kindle Fire. Asking for $4.99 for a game and then pushing IAPs is uncalled for and I do not end,1

you do not need to spend any real money on anything at any time.  I have actually played the game all day unlike so many childish people that reviewed the game based on what others said without even downloading it let alone playing it.  if you have never,1

this app is amazing. although the other reviews say that it is such a bad app its really not. yes I agree it is more of a hobby but still wither way it is really fun.,1
"So, normally this app is $5. and even after paying for it, you STILL have to pay even more REAL CASH to obtain items to play.  IAP's are the scourge of our time and we need to come together and boycott them  ALL! STAY AWAY!!",0
"This is less of a game and more of an activity. That being said, its a fairly enjoyable way to kill off some time on a lazy afternoon. Making the pottery allows you to tap into your creative side, and, tho the actual modifications you can make to the pot",0

Great Game !!!! Lots of pots to make ! Very fun.  YourAble To Make cups from Coffee Cups to jars To FoodBowls.,1
We HAVE to boycott IAP! Scamming us out of even more money in game . . . Don't think so!,0
"IAP does not always equal bad. There are TONS of games out there that offer the option to pay real money to get things. You know why? Because people are lazy, and would rather spend some pocket change to get it rather than work their way through the game",1
"I have no idea what the negitive reviews are about. I got this for free and I think its great.There is an Option to buy added tools later in the game, but so what. Its fun, there's no time limit,and no mess. Great App!",1

This game is pretty poor.  It stinks that the pay version has IAPs.  Its also very repetive and boring.  I do not recommend.,0

This is a really fun game but sadly it keeps crashing. Its unplayable. I hope they fix it. Its about matching two things to help you advance. Like you pick water and earth and that will give you a new element to play with. As I mentioned. the game crashe,0

This is a cool game. It is harder than it looks. There is currently a crash problem but I am sure it will be fixed with next update. This is sort of a puzzle type game and I love this type of a game on phones and tablets.,1

I love this game but this app sucks big time. it keeps force closing and I cant even play it. I fell cheated. hopefully they will fix this app and it can be played to its completion.,0
"Game is a bad rip off of Alchemy, which is far superior to this garbage, the game teases other chapters or modes but doesn't explain how to access them. App really isn't worth a try, 2.5 stars as an average review is too generous.",0
I loved it I was able to get going really fast. Also the hints helped me through times that I was confused in. I also really like the extra quests along the way. Yes it's easy toPlay because I beat it in under a week.,1

Doodle God is a game where u create &quot;elements&quot; such as airplanes or cars. this is one of my favorite apps which seems very fun to me. I love this app,1
"When I saw the game, it just looked like a easy game.y but as I got into the game,it looked fun and addicting. And I was right and right now, I'm on episode 2, with 111 creations and 15 groups too.",1
"A totally unique fun game. I always only get free apps. Don't deny a lot of you don't do the same. After I played this free version, I HAVE to buy the full version.",1
In my opinion it's great because you can turn off all the inappropriate stuff in the settings and you can make cool things great for a 9 year old :D,1

"Severely lags making the game unplayable. I have used the free version on ICS, and it was pretty fun. I haven't tried this version on any of my other devices, but at this point I will just uninstall and wait for an update.",0
This game best mirrors an actual pinball table.  I play it constantly.  I would recommend to anyone as their top pinball game.,1

This is a great solitaire game. I love having it on my Kindle Fire. So easy & so entertaining and so easy to play..,1
"cards too small, not as workable or customisable as I like. it is OK for a quick game, but I like playing for longer periods of time",0
This type of solitaire is what I like best and I found it at Amazon.I can take it with me anywhere. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD.I would recommend it to anyone who likes solitaire.,1
I enjoy playing solitaire and have for many years. It is convenient to play on the computer. My sight is not as good as it used to be so being able to see the cards on the computer is a plus.,1

I like this great game.  Please try this great game.  I really enjoy this great game.  great game.  try this.,1
Plain old sol.  This is an easy to use game that even gives hints when you are stumped and ready to quit.  It will deal hands that can be beat or random deals.  For the price it can't be beat.,1
Its boring and confusing! If I could rate this app NO stars I would. Why don't they offer no stars?I DO NOT recommend this app/game at all.Don't get it!When or if you get this game and hate it ....... don't complain because I warned you!!!,0

No good. Do not get this app. Don't even know how it made it in app store. Samsung fascinate. Delete and never come back. :),0
they say that it is free and you play maybe two or so levels and then you can't play anymore unless you buy the whole game so really not worth taking your time to dowload on anything unless you want to actually buy the game after a few mintues of playing,0
Loved this game!!!!  All strategy games are fun but thought this one was really fun and kept me entertained for quite a while.,1
if you guys are complaining I think you are crazy. Mine worked fine like the one on the computer. There is no difference. It may not have worked for you people but it worked fine for me. YOU WILL NEVR MAKE ME COMPLAIN!,1
"This game is way to hard and it is boring after awhile of playing it, so I don't have it on my Kindle fire",0
This farm game is very mediocre. Actually it sucks. The better farm game is Papaya Farm and its free to have the full version. Download it to your Android or iPhone and use referral code Steam007 to get 300 papayas plus some bonuses.,0
"The game only let me play one level before it shut down. I was considering buying the full version if Iiked the free version, but I'm staying away from this!",0

I wish I had read the reviews before buying. First bad app I've bought.  Don't waste your money.  What else can I say?,0
Maybe my luck has been better. The app works great. Facial recognition works fine and end result is hilarious. Very realistic too.,1

"loaded this to my kindle, nice to be able to listen to some shows that way, great app and it is free",1
Does exactly what it would do on a laptop but now I could use it on my phone.  Easy to navigate.,1
U- Stream app works great. It allows streaming content on U-Stream on a Kindle Fire that was unable to watch by just going to the U-Stream website. (Kindle users store this app on your cloud storage so as to not use up your internal memory.),1

I love the rdio service and this app does a great job of letting me access the content. The streaming works well and the offline listening is great.,1
"Web, mobile and tablet all work great with radio -- feels less bloated that Spotify as an experience and is great with its offline mode.  Feels like I have my music collection in the cloud.",1
"Just so we're clear, Rdio is paid subscription service for streaming music. It's comparable to Spotify, though I feel like Rdio has a better selection of songs. I switched from Spotify to Rdio and haven't looked back. The app works well and is organized ",1
did not like how this website was disorganize because it was difficult to find the songs.  Then the free songs they diplayed were terrible.,0
Music more music Rdio has great selection and customization. Only if they could get some ACDC and METALLICA that would be AWESOMENESS..,1
I don't really get the point of this.  All the music seems to be what they want to offer as apposed to finding music I like.  They also bomb your inbox with useless mail.,0

The app itself works great.  I got the two week free trial on my Kindle Fire and was very pleased with it.  But I was disappointed to find out that it was $10 A MONTH to use it on a tablet or mobile device after the two weeks were up.  That's $120 a year,0

"While I like this and use it a lot, requiring a list- based app to be removed in order to update, thereby eradicating all lists/data, is IDIOTIC! Solution: dev update protocol should incorporate automatic cloud backup and restore of all user data!",0
